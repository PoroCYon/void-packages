 On recent macOS, to allow sound input to be captured (for FFT textures to be generated), you need to: Open up System Preferences, click on Security & Privacy, click on the Privacy tab then click on the Microphone menu item. Make sure Bonzomatic.app is in the list and ticked.
 
 ## Configuration
-You can configure Bonzomatic by creating a `config.json` and placing it next to the binary executable you're planning to run in the working directory for the binary; Bonzomatic will helpfully print this directory out for you when you run it, and you can also pass a file (with absolute or relative path, whichever you want) as parameter to the executable to load any other file as `config.json`. This allows you to have multiple configurations for multiple situations.

Data (textures and last shader) will then be searched in a directory relative to where the `config.json` file was found. The only exception is if `config.json` is found in `/etc/bonzomatic` then data will be searched in `/usr/share/bonzomatic`.
