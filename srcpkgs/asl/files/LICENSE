LICENSING

Those who have already used the original DOS/Pascal version of AS
will know that AS is completely free: you may use and modify AS for
whatever purpose you like (regardless whether it is commercial or
not), given that you do not remove my copyright from the sources and
that programs that build upon the AS sources are given out under the
same license terms.  Of course, if you add something significant,
you may also add your own name to the copyright list!

To make things a bit more interesting (for me), I have added a detail
to the license terms of the C version: it is wineware!  If you want
and have time, you may send me a bottle of your favourite wine...
